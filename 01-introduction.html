        <h2>Why Offshore Process Engineering?</h2>
        <p>The offshore environment is one of the toughest, not only must designs work, they must:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Work reliably with little/no maintenance</b>: staffing/access/resources are hard.</li>
        <li><b>Be lightweight</b>: Structures can only take so much load, don't forget liquid weight too!</li>
        <li><b>Be safe even under failure</b>: Escape into the ocean is difficult, system must fail safe. </li>
        <li><b>Work anywhere</b>: Subsea process engineering is an extreme area. </li>
        <li><b>Small margins for overdesign</b>: All costs are high, forcing efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        These pressures force innovation, and offshore engineering leads and has
        led the way for much of the development of process engineering. We have
        learnt so much from this work.

          <h2>Transition to Net-Zero:<br/> Is offshore now irrelevant?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Much of this course will be about Upstream Oil and Gas
            processing and ≈70% of oil and gas production is for energy. Is this course still relevant?</li>
            <li>Most <del>oil</del> <em>energy</em> companies are touting net zero targets (e.g., BP, Total Energy, Shell 2050).
            </li>
            <li>
              UK Government has banned ICE car sales from 2030, hybrids banned from 2035.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carbon as a energy source is not tenable, but not only because of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions... 
              </li>
              <li>
              ...Its too expensive!
            </li>

            Onshore wind is the cheapest energy, followed by solar, but solar may
            overtake it as we increase capacity as both have positive "learning" rates. Coal and nuclear are far too
            expensive. <b>Offshore wind</b> is competitive and getting much better, and less likely to find objections from locals (except for Trump!).

          <li>
            So the climate crisis is being solved via the strongest forces known
            to man, capitalism, and the sun. Does this mean
            <b>offshore</b> hydrocarbon extraction is obsolete?
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>NO</b>. We will always need raw feedstocks of materials to
            continue to develop and improve humanity and the world. I'll try to
            explain this in the short and long term.
          </li>
          <li>
            Short term, shortages of materials can lead to unusual dynamics. For
            example, growing bioethanol crops for petrol/vegtable oil for diesel
            directly competes with food! Have you noticed that sunflower oil
            tracks diesel prices? All nations rely on cheap food (and clothes, etc.)
            to allow time for more advanced work, like education/research.
          </li>
          <li>
            We need a rapid transition to sustainable industry, but it must be a
            transition to prevent "larger" harm from competition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another example, batteries, at least in the short term, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve">appear
            to be the solution to transient renewable power</a>, what do we need
            for these?

          <p>LFP batteries are very promising, but other chemistries are more performant and need cobalt/nickel/magnanese.</p>

            <li>
              Offshore technology will also play a role in the transition
              through energy storage (i.e., hydrogen in underground reservoirs),
              or
              <b>CO<sub>2</sub>
              sequestration in offshore underground brine formations, which is upstream oil and gas processing in reverse</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interstingly, release of CO<sub>2</sub> must not only be stopped,
              it must be reversed. We have already "committed" to a sea level
              rise from our existing total emissions.

              <em>"We estimate median sea-level rise between 0.7 and 1.2 m, if net-zero greenhouse gas emissions are sustained until 2300, varying with the pathway of emissions during this century. Temperature stabilization below 2 °C is insufficient to hold median sea-level rise until 2300 below 1.5 m."</em>

            <li>Long term, we need technology and resources to be able to  more
            generally terraform earth to ensure it is a garden for all life.
            Preservation, expansion, and diversification of all life should be
            our goal.
            </li>
            <li>Just human life is still a big challenge for us, consider <b>Food security</b>.</li>
            <li><em>"...we estimate,
              that by 2000, nitrogen fertilizers were
              responsible for feeding 44% of the world’s
              population. Our updated estimate for
              2008 is 48% — so the lives of around
              half of humanity are made possible by
              Haber–Bosch nitrogen."</em><br/>

              Industrialization is now a basic necessity for half of humanity.
            </li>
            <li>The transition is needed here too. The Haber–Bosch uses methane
            to provide hydrogen to "fix" nitrogen into ammonia (CH<sub>4</sub>).
            Technology can generate green hydrogen for this process from
            electrolysis if we have sufficient clean energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              We could also still use methane for the hydrogen, and store the
              CO<sub>2</sub> or make carbon products out of it.

            <li>
              Technology may be able to solve all our problems (it has done so
              far), but only if we have resources and sound, safe, sustainable
              engineering.

          <h2>Learning objectives</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Offshore engineering in the Upstream Oil & Gas industry has a lot
              to teach us about efficient, safe, and optimized process
              engineering design due to its challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many techniques and specialized knowledge can be applied to other
              issues, like underground CO<sub>2</sub> storage, subsea mineral extraction, offshore wind (offshore structures),
              storage of gas/hydrogen (<a
              href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/aldbrough-gas-storage-site-could-be-converted-to-hold-hydrogen-5sq2wsqvt">Aldbrough
              gas storage site could be converted to hold hydrogen</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              We need to take a broader, data-driven approach to solving
              problems, nothing is ever straightforward. 
            </li>
            <li>
              This course is still under (re)development. I will happily hear
              suggestions on where it should be broadened out, and what topics
              it might be transferred to.

          <h2>Comments on the course</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
          The course is designed to allow you apply the UG chemical engineering
          skills you should already have developed. MSc students, the
          calculations should not be outside your skill set but may take some
          additional learning.
            </li><li>
          Please engage and discuss. All of you on
          the MEng programme could have graduated last year with a BEng (and many on the MSc already did), you’re
          already qualified engineers, lets have technical discussions. 
        </li><li>
          Question what you see, the upstream industry is huge and complex, not all of it can be presented in slides.
        </li><li>No topic is off limits. There is a lot of material – you will
          need to keep up with the tutorials.
        </li><li>
          You will use UniSim/Aspen/HYSYS for some of the tutorial problems. You
          can access this via <a

          <h2>Tutorials</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Weekly tutorials (see booklet in the menu, bottom-left) are where questions will be reviewed and discussed. The following week the tutorial model answers will be reviewed. Attempt the tutorials, don’t just read the answers – there is a lot of learning in struggling with a problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notes and tutorials are already posted but will be updated continuously (there’s always something new that people struggle with, or minor errors and ways to improve).
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix of units – this is deliberate as unfortunately many oil and gas regions still use Imperial/American units (take a look at Python’s pint library). The world is not ideal yet despite our best attempts…
